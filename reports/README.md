# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

### Question 3
> **A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework**
> **did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used the third-party framework `timm` in our project. The `create_model` function from this package allowed us to load a pretrained ResNet50 backbone, which we fine-tuned on our dataset for bird classification. Using a pretrained model helped us save time while improving performance, as the model had already learned features from a large dataset, providing a stronger starting point than training from scratch. This popular framework made it easy to work with state-of-the-art models like the one we chose and adapt it to our specific needs, greatly simplifying the process of setting up the model architecture.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

For python dependencies we use two key files: 
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the promary dependencies required for the application to run. 
- **requirements_tests.txt**: This file includes additional dependencies for testing. 

We use Docker to manage dependencies for our APIs. Each API has it's own dockerfile, that specifies the neccesary base image, dependencies, and configurations to setup the runtime enviroment. 

To get a copy of the developments enviroment, you would: 
* Cloone the repository. 
* Build and run the docker container. 
* Or alternativly, to run the setup locally; set up a virtual enviroment, activate it anf insdtall the dependencies. 

By using this appraoch, we manage to ensure consistency and reproducibility. 

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

We unfortunately didn't use the cookiecutter template for our project. However we tried to follow the structure of the template as much as possible. The project structure can be seen in the README.md file in the repository. We have all the same files, except for the visualize.py file, which we didn't need. We also created new files for having an explanability element in the project and a part of our API front end, which is the explanation.py and frontend.py files in the src folder, this creates a saliency map for our frontend. We misnamed the evaluate.py file, and called it test.py file instead.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We used the Ruff VSCode extension for linting and formatting, ensuring that our code followed consistent style and quality standards. Additionally, a GitHub workflow was set up to validate whether files pushed to the main branch adhered to Ruff formatting rules. If issues were detected, it provided clear suggestions for corrections. For typing, we implemented type annotations in certain files to improve code clarity and reliability, although this was not applied universally. As for documentation, while formal documentation practices were not established, we added comments in critical sections to explain complex logic and key functionalities.

These practices are crucial in larger projects for several reasons. Linting and formatting ensure a consistent codebase, making it easier for multiple contributors to read, understand, and modify the code without introducing unnecessary errors. Typing enhances code reliability by allowing static analysis tools to catch type-related bugs early. Documentation—whether formal or informal—provides essential context, which is especially valuable as projects grow in complexity.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**

--- question 7 fill here ---

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

When we omit the tests in the coverage report, we get a coverage of 83%, this not including code for the whole project but only code for the following files:

'''
Name              Stmts   Miss  Cover
-------------------------------------
src/__init__.py       0      0   100%
src/api.py           38      3    92%
src/datasets.py      83     20    76%
src/model.py         51      6    88%
-------------------------------------
TOTAL               172     29    83%
'''

Many of the files in the repository are untouched from the testing, and the testing we do is fairly simple. Even if we had 100% code coverage, we would not trust our code to be error-free. Code coverage is a metric that indicates the percentage of code that is executed by tests. While high code coverage is a good indicator of test quality, it does not guarantee that the tests are good or that the code is free of errors.

>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we used DVC to manage the dataset efficiently. Specifically, we tracked our dataset (CUB-200-2011) with DVC and stored it in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. By using DVC, we were able to version our dataset alongside the codebase. This allowed us to maintain reproducibility and avoided issues caused by outdated datasets. Also, it is considered a bad practice to store the dataset directly on GitHub, and keeping the dataset separate from it reduced the repository size substantially. Lastly, it simplified collaboration, as team members could pull the exact dataset version by simply running `dvc pull`, instead of having to download it manually from another source (e.g. Dropbox). So by using DVC, we improved reproducibility and prevented dataset management headaches.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

1. Compute
		Google Cloud's Compute service is used to obtain computing resources to run applications, including virtual machines (VMs) 		which we use to train out model and containers which we used to run our app.
2. Storage
		Google Cloud's Storage service offers scalable and secure storage and we used this for our training data, as well as storing 		our trained model and docker images.
3. AI/ML
		Google Cloud's AI/ML services are tools for building and deploying machine learning models. We used this service with vertex 		AI which we use to both train and deploy our for model to the buckets.


### Question 18

> *using a custom container: ...*
>
> Answer:

In this project, we used Vertex AI from Google Cloud to train our model. Compute Engine is the part of Google Cloud that helps us run virtual machines (VMs). Even though our model and dataset are small, Vertex AI automatically takes care of creating and managing the VMs for us. The VMs used were mainly CPU instances, which we chose to save on ressources and money and because of the simple model and dataset, this was sufficient. This setup lets us focus on training the model, while Vertex AI handles everything behind the scenes, like choosing and managing the VMs. This made the training process easier and faster without needing to manually set up or monitor the VMs.

![Diagram of our project](figures/diagram.png)

The diagram illustrates the project in three tiers: 

**At the first level, a user or developer interacts with the system.**

- A user will use the system by uploading an image an interactive interface. In this way the user interacts with our frontend application which is developed with Streamlit. 
- A developer can interact with the project by cloning the source code on GitHub. 

**The second level illustrates the frontend tool.**

- When a user uploads an image, Streamlit communicates with FastAPI, which acts as a gateway to the backend. The image is processed, and FastAPI returns the result (bird species prediction) to the user through the interface. 
- To make the predictions FastAPI fetches a pre-trained model (fine-tuned ResNet) hosted in the backend, to classify the uploaded image
- For developers, when the system is running, the newest Docker image is pulled to ensure the latest backend version is used. All dependencies required by FastAPI are encapsulated within the Docker container, ensuring portability and consistency.
- FastAPI connects to Google Cloud to fetch the model for classification. 
- Google Cloud SDK is used to push the Docker container to the cloud. 

**The third level illustrates the backend**

- The backend contains a training pipeline, witch is optimized with Pytorch Lightning. 

- The training process is logged using WeightAndBiases and Hydra. 

- The training pipeline fecthes data from DVC. 

- The trained model is saved in Google Cloud. 

- We also integrated several tests; testing both the training process and data loading in GitHub Actions.

- When a developer commits changed to the repository a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.

- For the tests to run, Github Actions fetches the model and data using DVC.
